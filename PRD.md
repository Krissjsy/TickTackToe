PRD: Tic-Tac-Toe Game (React JS)
🔑 Goal of the App

Design and implement a simple Tic-Tac-Toe web game using React JS. The app should allow two players to take turns, determine a winner or draw, and provide the option to restart the game.

🧩 Feature Categories
✅ 1. Core Gameplay Features

Game Board

3x3 grid, clickable squares.

Each click places X or O depending on the turn.

Turn Management

Alternates between Player X and Player O.

Display current player at the top.

Win/Draw Detection

Detect 8 winning patterns (rows, columns, diagonals).

Detect if all squares are filled without a winner → Draw.

Game Over State

Display message: “Player X Wins!”, “Player O Wins!”, or “It’s a Draw!”

Disable further clicks when game ends.

Restart Button

Resets the board and starts a new game.

🎨 2. UI/UX Requirements

Minimalist Design using Tailwind CSS.

Board Layout: centered 3x3 grid with large squares.

Current Turn Indicator: text above the board.

End Game Modal/Message: appears on win/draw.

Restart Button: visible after game ends.

Optional Extra: Dark Mode toggle.

⚙️ Technical Requirements
Frontend

Framework: React JS (functional components + hooks).

Styling: Tailwind CSS.

State Management: React useState + custom hooks.

Game Logic

Board State: Array of 9 elements [null | 'X' | 'O'].

Turn State: Boolean or string ('X' | 'O').

Winner Detection: Predefined array of winning index patterns.

🧩 System Components & Tasks
1. Project Setup

Task: Initialize project

Use Vite + React (preferred for speed).

Install Tailwind CSS.

Configure ESLint + Prettier.

Acceptance Criteria:

Running npm run dev starts React app.

Tailwind styling works.

2. Game State Management

Schema:

type Player = 'X' | 'O';
type SquareValue = Player | null;

interface GameState {
  board: SquareValue[]; // 9 elements
  currentPlayer: Player;
  winner: Player | null;
  isDraw: boolean;
}


Tasks:

Implement board state as useState (array of 9).

Track currentPlayer.

Add function checkWinner(board: SquareValue[]): Player | null.

Add function checkDraw(board: SquareValue[]): boolean.

Acceptance Criteria:

Board starts empty.

Current player alternates each turn.

Winner detected correctly across 8 patterns.

Draw detected when board full and no winner.

3. UI Components

Components:

<Square /> → individual button for each cell.

  [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8], // cols
  [0,4,8], [2,4,6]           // diagonals
];


Tasks:

Implement function to check win condition using WIN_PATTERNS.

Prevent overwriting filled squares.

Stop play once winner or draw detected.

Acceptance Criteria:

Cannot click already filled square.

Game is visually centered and mobile-responsive.

Clear distinction between X and O.

Restart button styled consistently.

6. Testing

Tasks:

Write unit tests for checkWinner and checkDraw.

Write component test for <Board /> ensuring turn alternation.

Test restart resets game.

Acceptance Criteria:

All tests pass via npm test.

7. Deployment

Tasks:
